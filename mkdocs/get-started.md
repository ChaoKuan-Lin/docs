# Getting Started

This short tutorial will walk you through the basic setups of your MoBagel account.

---
## Apply for an account
To use the MoBagel API, you will need a MoBagel Account. If you need to create an account, please visit [here](https://app.mobagel.com/signup).

## Create a new device
Device is the basic unit of MoBagel platform. Each device should only belong to a single product, but a product can contain multiple devices. For more information about [device](user-guide/introduction.md#device).

1. Choose how many devices you want to add, and click `Create`.

## Send a report
1. Get current timestamp

    Timestamp is a very important attribute for MoBagel Platform. Get your current timestamp in `millisecond` first.

    > *You can get timestamp [here](http://currentmillis.com)*

2. Generate a token

    MoBagel's API uses token-based authorizations. Tokens are generated by the users, and the server produces corresponding tokens to verify user identities. More information about [token](user-guide/introduction.md#token)

    How to generate a token:

        token = SHA256( product_id:product_key:device_id:device_key:timestamp )

    > *You can calculate SHA256 [here](http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator)*

3. Send a report

    Assume that your product id is `A001`, device id is `D001`, timestamp is `1446319244147`, and token you generated is Token `T001`.

    To get your device information, your sample request will be:

    + Host: `https://api.mobagel.com/products/A001/devices/D001/reports`
    + Header: 

            Product-Id: A001
            Device-Id: D001
            Timestamp: 1446319244147
            Token: T001

    + Body:

            {
                "data":
                {
                    "state": "normal",
                    "latitude": 12.321, 
                    "longitude": -32.12 
                }
            }

    *For more information about body, please see [introduction](user-guide/introduction.md)*

    You will receive a sample response like this:

        HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED
        Date: Mon, 26 Oct 2015 07:48:06 GMT
        Content-Length: 81
        Connection: keep-alive
        Content-Type: application/json
        Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

        {
            "code": 201,
            "message": "success",
            "data": "$reportId"
        }

    > *You can send your sample request [here](https://apigee.com/console/others)*
