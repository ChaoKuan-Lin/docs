# Examples

In order tuse MoBagel to effectively manage and analyze your devices, you will need address the two following questions about your product:

## What custom properties or events should I add to my report? 

Custom properties or events enables you to track anything that your hardware allows, such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, accelerometers, feature usage, and status of components. To determine which custom properties to add, you should first list out all of the possible properties that your hardware is capable of tracking, and then ask yourself which of these properties would help your device management and analytics, such as which properties will lead to malfunctioning, or which properties will give you the customer insights that you want.

## How often should I send reports?

The frequency of sending reports varies according to the type of your product. It can range from once every few days to once every few seconds. If your product requires constant and careful monitoring, such as industrial machines or security systems, then you should send reports frequently in order to avoid delays in error detection.

# Example: Smart Home

## Smart Air Conditioner

If you have a smart air conditioner, you might ask yourself these questions to help you decide which custom properties or events to track:


* What do I want to know about my users?

* How can I track these information?   

* How do they actually use your product?  

* What is the user's exact temperature preference over the course of a day/month/year?  

* Is the compressor functional?

* Is the ambient temperature abnormal?  

* Is the air conditioner actually saving the user on energy bills?


### Report basic device state with location

```http
POST /products/A001/devices/D001/reports

{
    "data":
    {
        "state": "Normal",
        "latitude": 12.321,
        "longitude": -32.12
    }
}
```

### Report custom device 

(including Device-ID, Mode, Temperature, Ambient-Temperature, Fan-Speed, Humidity, Power-Consumption, Power-Stability and Compressor-Status.)

```http
POST /products/A001/devices/D001/reports

{
    "data":
    {
        "state": "Normal",
        "c_id": 5512,
        "c_mode": "cooling",
        "c_temperature": 23.5,
        "c_t-unit": "째C",
        "c_ambient_temp": 27,
        "c_at-unit": "째C",

        "c_p-unit": "kW",
        "c_power-stable": "normal",
        "c_compressor": "normal"

    }
}
```


## Smart Air Cleaner

#### What report needs?
How to get a useful report instead of unorganized, messy information?  
First, you'll have to decide what you want to know from the users.  
Such as how do users actually use your product,  
when does the user turn on/off,  
which speed mode does the user prefer,  
How's the air quality?  
Moreover, you can visualise user's bedtime through switching the mode to night mode.  
Is the fan running normally or too much fluff sticking to it?  
You might also want to know about  the status of the filter, in order to proactively sell new filters to the user. 
  

Every report will contain rich metadata according to your custom settings. You can easily monitor and manage your devices on MoBagel's dashboard. Moreover, with real-time predictive analytics, preventing errors is also the main function of our service.

#### Frequency of sending report?
According to different products, you can set the frequency of sending report.  
As to Smart Air Cleaner, our default value will be 5 minutes.
Every 5 minutes, the Smart Air Cleaner will send a report up to the cloud.

Example: Report basic device state with location
```http
POST /products/A002/devices/D001/reports

{
    "data":
    {
        "state": "Normal",
        "latitude": 14.174,
        "longitude": -72.17
    }
}
```
Example: Report custom device   
(Including Device-ID, Mode, Speeed, Air-Quality, Fan-Status, Compressor-Status, Filter-Usage.)

```http
