# Preparation

# Creating an account
If you do not have an account, please create an account [here](https://app.mobagel.com/signup). After you create an account, you will be directed to the dashboard.

# Creating a new product
To use MoBagel, you first have to create a `product`, which is essentially a group of same `device`. You will be prompted to create a new product when you first enter the dashboard.

After you create a `product`, you can go to **_Configuration -> Product Settings_** Info to retrieve your `product_key`, which will be used to create `device` later on.

# Adding custom properties

<img src="../../../img/MoBagel_Getting_Started/Config_settings.png" width="200">   
In **_Product Settings_** under **_Configuration_**, you can add custom properties to your product.   
Custom properties should have the following requirements:

* **ID**:   
Property ID (with the exception of `state`) should always begin with `c_` to indicate that it is a custom property. In addition, property IDs are unique and cannot repeat with itself.

* **Name**:   
The property name is your nickname for your property. For example, if your ID is `c_012421`, you can set the name as `temperature`. The modules in the dashboard will display your property name instead of your property ID.

* **Type**:   
There are two types of properties: `string` and `number`.  

**_Please note that you must configure your properties in your configuration before you send your first customized report._**

# Example Walkthrough

## Registering your first device

Once you generated a product_key from the dashboard, you can use the product_key and registerDevice function to register a device in your application.

```
# ENV: python3.5.1 / python2.7.6
import json
import pybagel

# Initialize a client instance by product_key
c = pybagel.MoBagelClient(
    product_key="1111111111222222222233333333334444444444555555555566666666667777"
)

# Custom properties, should be created in the MoBagel dashboard
content = {
    "c_string": "7777",
    "c_number": 7777
}

# register a new device
status_code, body = c.registerDevice(content)
response = json.loads(body.decode('utf-8'))

# return a new device_key
print("Status code:", status_code)
print("Response data:", response)
print("Device Key:", response["key"])

```

## Connecting custom properties or events

In your device application, you will need to prepare your report before sending it to MoBagel.  

* Determining different `states` of your devices to send along with your report

```
//example states

"state": "normal"
"state": "error"
```

* Adding custom properties or events with a key beginning with `c_`
    
```
//example custom properties or events

"c_temperature": 30
"c_event": "turned_on"
```

* Deciding when to send reports (time, frequency, events)

## Sending first report
```
# ENV: python3.5.1 / python2.7.6
import json
try:
    import pybagel
except:
    import sys
    import os
    filepath = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    sys.path.append(filepath+'/..')
    import pybagel

# Initialize a Client Instance by product_key
# You can register a device and get a device_key according "example_registerDevice.py"
c = pybagel.MoBagelClient(
    device_key="1111111111222222222233333333334444444444555555555566666666667777"
)

# Custom properties, should be created in the MoBagel dashboard
content = {
    "state": "normal",
    "c_category": "555",
    "c_numeric": 555
}

# send report with device key
status_code, body = c.sendReport(content)
response = json.loads(body.decode('utf-8'))

# return status_code, product_id
print("Status code:", status_code)
print("Response data:", response)
```
