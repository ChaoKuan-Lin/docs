# MoBagel Python SDK   
Use MoBagel Python SDK to quickly install MoBagel to your device(s). MoBagel Python SDK is an open-source python library that makes it easy to integrate your python application with MoBagel.

# Preparation

## Creating an account
If you do not have an account, please create an account [here](https://app.mobagel.com/signup). After you create an account, you will be directed to the dashboard.

## Creating a new product  
To use MoBagel, you first have to create a `product`, which is essentially a group of same `device`. You will be prompted to create a new product when you first enter the dashboard.

After you create a `product`, you can go to Configuration -> Device Info to retrieve your `product_key`, which will be used to create `device` later on.

## Adding custom properties

In the Configuration, you can add custom properties to your product. Custom properties should have the following requirements:

* **ID**: Property ID (with the exception of `state`) should always begin with `c_` to indicate that it is a custom property. In addition, property IDs are unique and cannot repeat with itself.

* **Name**: The property name is your nickname for your property. For example, if your ID is 'c_012421', you can set the name as 'temperature'. The modules in the dashboard will display your property name instead of your property ID.

* **Type**: There are two types of properties: category and numeric. Category uses a set of string options and numeric uses numeric options (optional).

* **Options**:
    - **Category**: please add all the possible string values of your property by typing in the options column. The server will use this to prevent your devices from sending erroraneous reports.
    
    - **Numeric** (optional): please set a min and max value for your numeric property to help protect your data from errors. For example, if your numeric property is humidity level, then you can set min and max to 0 and 100, respectively. This will allow our system to reject any reports with humidity levels that are not in this range because those values are theoretically impossible (i.e. negative humidity level).

Please note that you must configure your properties in your configuration before you send your first customized report.

## Installation
Before you run mobagel-python-sdk, you need to install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) first.

pip (Mac OS X)
```shell
    $ sudo easy_install pip
```

pip (Ubuntu 14.04)
```shell
    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential 
    $ sudo pip install --upgrade pip 
```

mobagel-python-sdk
```shell

# Example Walkthrough
## Full Example
You can see example codes at github: /mobagel-python-sdk/example/
[click me](https://github.com/MoBagel/mobagel-python-sdk/tree/master/example)

```
    __author__ = "MoBagel Inc."
    
    import json
    import pybagel
    from pprint import pprint
    
    print "\nThis is MoBagel Python SDK sample, you can learn how to `register device` and `report state` in this sample code\n"
    
    product_key = "1111111111222222222233333333334444444444555555555566666666667777"
    # Initialize a Client Instance by product_key
    client = pybagel.Client(product_key=product_key)
    
    print "Register device..."
    # register a device_key by client
    code, content = client.registerDevice()
    response = json.loads(content.decode('utf-8'))
    print "Data response: "
    pprint(response)
    
    print "\n========================================================\n"
    
    print "Send report..."
    
    device_key = response["data"]["attributes"]["key"];
    content = {
                "state": "Put your state here!",
                "c_customization" : "python_sdk_test",
                "c_develop_zone" : "PythonSDK"
            }
    
    # SendReport
    code, content = client.sendReport(
        device_key=device_key,
        content=content
        )
    # return report_id and report_timestamp
    response = json.loads(content.decode('utf-8'))
    print "Data response: "
    pprint(response)

```

## Registering your first device

Once you generated a product_key from the dashboard, you can use the product_key and registerDevice function to register a device in your application.

```
    # Import package
    import pybagel
    import json

    product_key = "YOUR_PRODUCT_KEY"
    # Initialize a Client Instance by product_key
    client = pybagel.Client(product_key=product_key)
    
    # Register a device_key by client
    code, content = client.registerDevice()
    response = json.loads(content.decode('utf-8'))
    device_key = response["data"]["attributes"]["key"];
    # Save device_key

```

## Connecting custom properties or events

In your device application, you will need to prepare your report before sending it to MoBagel.  

* Determining different `states` of your devices to send along with your report

```
//example states

"state": "normal"
"state": "error"
```

* Adding custom properties or events with a key beginning with `c_`
    
```
//example custom properties or events

"c_temperature": 30
"c_event": "turned_on"
```

* Deciding when to send reports (time, frequency, events)

## Sending first report
```
    print "Send report..."
    
    device_key = response["data"]["attributes"]["key"];
    content = {
                "state": "Put your state here!",
                "c_customization" : "python_sdk_test",
                "c_develop_zone" : "PythonSDK"
            }
    
    # SendReport
    code, content = client.sendReport(
        device_key=device_key,
        content=content
        )
    # return report_id and report_timestamp
    response = json.loads(content.decode('utf-8'))
    print "Data response: "
    pprint(response)
```
