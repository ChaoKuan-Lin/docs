# Introduction

This section covers the basics of the MoBagel API and how you can utilize MoBagel's platform to improve your IoT devices.

---
## Token
MoBagel's API uses token-based authorizations. Tokens are generated by the users, and the server produces corresponding tokens to verify user identities.

#### How to generate tokens?
As an additional layer of security, tokens are generated only through `SHA256`. A unique token needs to be generated for each request. This is called a One-Time Password (OTP), and the API uses OTPs to validate each request. The OTP token can be generated by:

    token = SHA256( product_id:product_key:device_id:device_key:timestamp )

+ product_id: Your product id
+ product_key: Your product key
+ device_id: Your device id
+ device_key: Your device key
+ timestamp: Your current timestamp in milliseconds (13bytes)

---

## Request
To access the MoBagel API, you first have to set up http headers. Add the following headers to your requests:

+ product_id
+ device_id
+ timestamp
+ token

If you use `POST` method, the Content-Type must be `application/json`, and the post data should follow the format below:

    {
        "data": {
            "field": "value"
        }
    }

**Note:** field will be defined by each API

## Response
For each successful response, the format will look like:

    {
        "code": $code,
        "timestamp": $timestamp,
        "data": $data
    }

For each failed response, the format will look like:

    {
        "code": $code,
        "timestamp": $timestamp,
        "message": $message
    }

## Vendor
The vendor or `vendor_id` is your MoBagel acccount. Each MoBagel account has a unique `vendor_id` used to distinguish your account from other MoBagel accounts.

---

## Product
The product is your IoT product. Whether you have an existing product or wish to create a new product, the product first has to be created on the platform. For example, if you are a TV manufacturer, the product is the TV. If you produce two types of TV, then you need to create two products.

To create a product, you need to give a unique global `product_id`. You cannot use an `product_id` that has already been taken by others.

After creating an product, you will receive a 64bytes `product_key` generated by MoBagel. Please store the `product_key` in a safe place as it is very important to your product.

---

## Device
Devices belongs to products. Each device belongs to a specific product, and a product may contain several devices.

To create a device, you do not have to give a `device_id`. Instead, the system will give you one.

After creating a device, you will also receive a `device_key`. Please also store the `device_key` in a safe place as it is very important to your device.

Attribute:

+ device_id
+ device_key
+ name
+ description
+ activate_time
+ update_time
+ create_time
+ masters
+ slaves
+ report_timestamp
+ report_state
+ report_ip
+ report_latlng
+ report_country
+ report_city
+ report_countrycode

#### Get device information

Method: `GET`

Path: `/products/{product_id}/devices/{device_id}`

| Parameter        | Type    | Description                                |
| :--:             | :-----: | :----                                      |
| fields (optional) | string  | Attributes of the device. Seperated by `,` |


Example: Get device's all information
```http
GET /products/A001/devices/D001
```
Example: Get device's name, update time
```http
GET /products/A001/devices/D001?fields=name,update_time
```

## Relatives
Relatives are used to indicate the relationship between devices. For each device, there are two relatives, `master` and `slave`. For more information about relatives, please see [authentication](authentication.md)

#### Update device relatives

Method: `POST`

Path: `/products/{product_id}/devices/{device_id}/relatives`

| Parameter  | Type    | Description                |
| :--:       | :-----: | :----                      |
| method     | string  | Only can be `ADD` or `DEL` |
| level      | string  | Only can be `master`       |
| device_ids | array   | Device Ids yo set          |


Example: Set `D002` and `D003` as `D001` masters
```http
POST /products/A001/devices/D001/relatives

{
    "data":
    {
        "method": "ADD",
        "level": "master",
        "device_ids": ["D002", "D003"]
    }
}
```

## Command
Command can be sent to devices from users.
